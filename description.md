Let’s now dive into the video's content ! 

Which leader was the most popular between 2005 and 2019 ?
We’ve handpicked 5 country leader’s in different parts of the world, all of whom were in charge between 2005 and 2019: Poutine, Obama, Cameron, Al Thani and of course, Trump. By analyzing the videos featuring these power players in the title, we can get a glimpse of their popularity ! 
We will focus on specific bubbles: first, the bubbles of each channel, and then the bubbles within a channel. The goal is to analyze how many videos with certain personalities in the title, users of the bubble have commented on, and what percentage of each bubble is involved in these comments.

Let’s first look at the channel’s bubbles :

Trump seems to be the most popular! He is cited in the title of more than 100000 videos for the different clusters. That’s a lot ! Furthermore, almost all the users in each cluster have commented on videos with his name… But that doesn’t mean they’re fans; they could be haters!
On the other hand, Al Thani and Putin don’t seem to be very popular. Almost no videos featuring them were retrieved. Nevertheless, a small portion of Al Jazeera’s users (AJE) seems to be interested in Al Thani! That makes sense, as he is the Emir of Qatar, and AJE is a Middle Eastern news channel.



But what about different categories? One might ask if certain topics in news and politics appear more frequently than others, and how much interest the different users in the bubbles have in them!
Let’s dive into these topics: Climate, Education, Gender, Religion, and Abortion.

Wow, climate seems to be the most popular topic! Surprisingly, abortion and gender have taken second place on the podium. Let’s say it’s the trend of the last decade, where we finally discuss these topics. Interestingly, religion and education aren’t as popular, but it’s worth noting that BBC and AJE seem to have the most interested users in these topics. Abortion and gender are less popular among AJE’s users compared to those of the other channels. Fox seems to have the most interesting users in the climate, gender and abortion categories.
This shows how different users are answering to a broad number of categories, with some diving into the hot-button issues of today while others are sticking with the classics !


But wait… What about within my channel bubbles ? Can we generalize this to all the users or just to specific ones?
Let’s look at our bubbles within the channels :

Trump seems to be very popular among users across all bubbles! Except for one bubble in AJE, where only 50% of users appear to be interested in Trump. In contrast, Obama is not very popular in AJE bubbles but is highly popular among BBC News users, despite it being a British channel. 



And what about the categories ?

That’s interesting—while categories seem equally popular in CNN and BBC, the other three channels show distinct preferences within each bubble. In ABC, one bubble appears uninterested in religion and climate, while another seems to disregard religion and abortion. In AJE, the differences are even more pronounced! One bubble seems to focus solely on climate, though it remains a small category, suggesting another topic might capture their interest. In BBC, one bubble appears particularly interested in religion-related videos.
