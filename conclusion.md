# Conclusion ðŸ‘€ðŸ«§ðŸ˜Š


To conclude, the commenting patterns of highly active users on videos within the News & Politics category for the 5 leading English speaking news publishers (CNN, BBC, ABC , AJE and FOX) were studied. 
Distinct clusters were identified based on a threshold for highly active users with most clusters defined as distinct bubbles. However, ABC displayed unusual behavior, showing a larger overlap between bubbles than within them. 
Using a clustering algorithm, clear bubbles were defined for each channel, indicating distinct groups within a channel, each potentially reflecting unique patterns or interests.  

Regarding the pattern of diversification of sources , it was found that  AJE , BBC and ABC clusters (identified as  bubbles) tend  to diversify their sources significantly  while CNN and FOX clusters diversify less, with the Fox news cluster showing the least diversification. 
Furthermore, turning to patterns in terms of content of videos, users displayed diverse interests , some gravitating toward the latest news topics, while others focused on timeless subjects that have been discussed for decades. 
One consistent finding was the popularity of Trump, who emerged as the most significant leader among the five leaders weâ€™ve compared.
Across all bubbles,  Trump appeared to dominate user interest, except for one bubble in AJE, where only 50% of users seemed interested in him.

Finally, category analysis revealed that even within the same channel, bubbles demonstrate distinct preferences for certain topics. This suggests that bubbles within a channel are not homogeneous but instead reflect a range of diverse interests among their members.
