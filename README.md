# “Are You Stuck in a YouTube Bubble? It's Time to Expand Your Information Sources!”

Nowadays most of the information is digitalized (literature, pictures, videos…), thus making an enormous amount of information available, which also implies much more fake news. Not every information is trustworthy. A widely accepted advice to avoid misinformation is to stay well informed, i.e. one should diversify its sources. 


One common way to get more information about a topic is youtube. On this social media, a large variety of users and videos can be found. Some watch a broad range of videos or channels, others watching similar videos of the same channel. These users can be regrouped by diverse criterias. Users-clusters can be defined as clusters of youtube users, which are formed by particularly active people within a channel. These clusters reflect communities invested into the same channel but don't yet imply that they don’t diversify their sources to retrieve information on a particular topic.


These clusters can evolve into bubbles, where users become confined to specific content, limiting exposure to other points of view. In these bubbles, interactions are mostly between individuals who share the same interests, whether it's the same video subjects or channels followed.
A content category proning this is News and politics (N&P) as it is inherently polarizing and tends to provoke strong opinions and engagement from diverse groups of people.


Therefore one can ask itself if clusters in our dataset are indicative of bubbles with limited perspective diversity ? Do commenters of major news channels form bubbles, or do they behave similarly to random Youtube users ?How isolated are the bubbles within the N&P community ? For what purpose do the identified bubbles use N&P content (e.g politics, daily news, etc.) ? Are the bubbles isolated due to the media they refer to, or the common topics of interest ?


To address these questions, we will first explore Youtube’s dynamics, focusing on the journey from content creation to how users engage with it. Secondly, meaningful users-clusters will be identified to go beyond the individual activity of each user to have a look at the group effect. From those identified clusters, shared viewing patterns will be uncovered by the creation of bubbles. Finally , in those bubbles , connections between shared videos will be unveiled.
