All the channels exhibit highly skewed distributions, with the key distinction being the range of comment counts across each channel. AJE seems to be the channel with the most users that write a small numbers of comments, and Fox the lowest of such commenters. What stands out in these distributions is that they all have a "long tail", meaning that there exist users posting significantly more comments than the very large majority of users. This suggests that the more active authors can be identified as distinct clusters based on their comment volume.
One can see that Fox users tend to be way more active then others !!

We will take the thresold : 90th percentile, as it is already a big set of users. It is statistically relevant because it is taking the most active users for each channels. 
I.e, the clusters of the differents channels will be compose 10% most active users of each channels

## Venn diagram

One can see that only 61 most active users are most active users of all the 5 channels! Some overlap can be seen, but there is still a lot of people that only are most active user in specific channels
