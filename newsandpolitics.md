As explained beforehand, only a small number of users post a lot of comments. Those are the more susceptible to share increased similarities in their viewing patterns. We need to isolate them from the rest of users, who are not as much invested. 
Therefore we needed to set a threshold.

The 99% percentile threshold was chosen,  as it is already a big set of users. It is statistically relevant because it is taking the most active 1% users for each channels. 

Based on this threshold, clusters are created for each channel regrouping 1% of the most active users. 

In our study we are interested in exploring the existence of isolated groups where the users do most likely not interact with each other.

Regarding the Venn diagram, we see that out of 49 480 only 122 are shared across all channels, suggesting minime cross-channel interactions. 

| Channel | Percentage of Users Not Overlapping with Other Channels |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| CNN     | 55.8%                                                   |
| ABC     | 70.6%                                                   |
| BBC     | 66.1%                                                   |
| AJE     | 62.9%                                                   |
| FOX     | 63.7%                                                   |


Additionally, approximately 60% of the total users for each channel primarily watch content from their channel as seen on the table above.This suggests a certain alignement of the users in the clusters with the channels content. 

The difference in the number of active users per cluster also suggest that some channels have a more active user base than others. Therefore, it can be assumed that each channel attracts a distinct group of highly active users, with some overlap of users also commenting on videos from other channels.

Overall, the clusters  exhibit similar tendency, raising the intriguing interrogation of whether this reflects similarities in the content they consume.
